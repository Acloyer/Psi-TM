### Red-Team Round 2

- Critical: Dual formulations may strengthen assumptions → Mitigation: alt forms cross-reference canonical IDs and imply originals; no stronger premises introduced.
- High: DAG edge omissions → Mitigation: validator ensures coverage vs `paper/claims.yaml`.
- Medium: Figure path sprawl → Mitigation: enforcement to `fig/` only; notebooks save under `fig/` and `results/DATE/...`.
