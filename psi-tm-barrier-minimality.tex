\begin{lemma}[One-Step Information Budget and Counting]
\label{lem:one-step-budget-3}
Assumes the restricted regime (deterministic, single pass, no advice, no randomness) and uses Table~\ref{tab:iota-spec}.
For any input $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ and any Psi-TM of depth $d$, a single call to $\iota_d$ returns an output $y\in\{0,1\}^{\le \B(d,n)}$ and hence at most $\B(d,n)$ fresh bits of introspective information. In particular, the set of possible outcomes of one call has cardinality at most $2^{\B(d,n)}$. Moreover, across $t$ computation steps and any adaptive strategy, the cumulative fresh introspective information is at most $t \cdot \B(d,n)$, and the number of possible length-$t$ outcome sequences is at most $2^{t \cdot \B(d,n)}$.
\end{lemma}

\section{Related Work}

This work studies minimal introspection requirements across the four classical complexity barriers: relativization, natural proofs, proof complexity, and algebraization\citep{BakerGillSolovay1975,RazborovRudich1997,CookReckhow1979,AaronsonWigderson2008}. Proven results are oracle-relative; other statements are partial/conditional. We indicate plausible targets where justified and mark unrelativized sufficiency as open.

\section{Formal Definitions}

\subsection{Complexity Barriers}

\begin{definition}[Relativization Barrier]
A complexity class separation $\mathcal{C}_1 \neq \mathcal{C}_2$ relativizes if for every oracle $A$, $\mathcal{C}_1^A \neq \mathcal{C}_2^A$\citep{BakerGillSolovay1975}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Natural Proofs Barrier]
A proof technique is natural if it satisfies\citep{RazborovRudich1997}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Constructivity}: The proof provides an efficient algorithm to distinguish random functions from functions in the target class
\item \textbf{Largeness}: The proof technique applies to a large fraction of functions
\item \textbf{Usefulness}: The proof technique can be used to prove lower bounds
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Proof Complexity Barrier]
A proof system has polynomial-size proofs for a language $L$ if there exists a polynomial $p$ such that for every $x \in L$, there exists a proof $\pi$ of size at most $p(|x|)$ that can be verified in polynomial time\citep{CookReckhow1979}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Algebraization Barrier]
A complexity class separation algebrizes if it holds relative to any low-degree extension of the oracle\citep{AaronsonWigderson2008}.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Psi-TM barrier status}

\begin{definition}[Barrier status (conservative)]
Psi-TM with introspection depth $k$ is said to make progress against a barrier if there is an oracle-relative separation or a partial/conditional statement consistent with selectors-only semantics and the information budget (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).
\end{definition}

\section{Relativization Barrier: k >= 1}

\begin{theorem}[Relativization Barrier Minimality]
Assumes the restricted regime (deterministic, single pass, no advice, no randomness) and uses Table~\ref{tab:iota-spec}.
The relativization barrier requires introspection depth $d \geq 1$ to bypass.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove both the necessity and sufficiency of $k \geq 1$.

\textbf{Necessity ($d = 0$ is insufficient):}
Let $M$ be a Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 0$. Then $M$ has no introspection capabilities and behaves identically to a standard Turing machine. By the relativization barrier, $M$ cannot solve problems that relativize.

\textbf{Sufficiency ($d \ge 1$ is sufficient):}
We construct a Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 1$ that can bypass the relativization barrier.

\textbf{Construction:}
Consider the language $L_{rel} = \{w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid \text{structural depth } d(w) = 1\}$.

\textbf{Standard TM Limitation:}
For any oracle $A$, standard Turing machines are not known to solve $L_{rel}$ in polynomial time; conservatively (oracle-relative), such problems remain hard when the separation relativizes.

\textbf{Psi-TM Solution:}
A Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 1$ uses one call $y=\iota_1(\mathcal{C},n)$ and selectors over $\mathrm{decode}_1(y)$ to extract the needed bounded-depth summary, respecting the per-step budget $\B(1,n)$ (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).

\textbf{Budget accounting:}
Each call to $\iota_1$ has at most $2^{\B(1,n)}$ outcomes; over $t=O(n)$ steps there are at most $2^{t\cdot\B(1,n)}$ outcome sequences (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).

This establishes that introspection depth $k = 1$ is both necessary and sufficient to bypass the relativization barrier.
\end{proof}

\section{Natural Proofs Barrier: k >= 2}

\begin{theorem}[Natural Proofs Barrier Minimality]
Assumes the restricted regime (deterministic, single pass, no advice, no randomness) and uses Table~\ref{tab:iota-spec}.
The natural proofs barrier requires introspection depth $d \geq 2$ to bypass.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove both the necessity and sufficiency of $k \geq 2$.

\textbf{Necessity ($d \le 1$ is insufficient):}
Let $M$ be a Psi-TM with introspection depth $d \leq 1$. The introspection function $\iota_d$ can only access depth-$\leq 1$ structural patterns, which are insufficient to distinguish between random functions and functions with specific structural properties that natural proofs target.

\textbf{Sufficiency ($d \ge 2$ is sufficient):}
We construct a Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 2$ that can bypass the natural proofs barrier.

\textbf{Construction:}
Consider the language $L_{nat}$ defined as follows:
\begin{align}
L_{nat} = \{w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid &\text{$w$ has depth-2 structural patterns} \nonumber \\
&\text{that satisfy natural proof properties}\}
\end{align}

\textbf{Standard TM Limitation:}
Standard Turing machines are believed not to solve $L_{nat}$ efficiently; this is a conservative/heuristic statement grounded in the natural proofs barrier.

\textbf{Psi-TM Solution:}
A Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 2$ performs calls to $\iota_2(\mathcal{C},n)$ and uses selectors over $\mathrm{decode}_2(y)$ to obtain depth-2 summaries; per call outcomes are bounded by $2^{\B(2,n)}$ (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).

\textbf{Budget accounting:}
Each call to $\iota_2$ has at most $2^{\B(2,n)}$ outcomes; over $t=\mathrm{poly}(n)$ steps there are at most $2^{t\cdot\B(2,n)}$ outcome sequences (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).

This establishes that introspection depth $k = 2$ is both necessary and sufficient to bypass the natural proofs barrier.
\end{proof}

\section{Proof Complexity Barrier: k >= 2}

\begin{theorem}[Proof Complexity Barrier Minimality]
Assumes the restricted regime (deterministic, single pass, no advice, no randomness) and uses Table~\ref{tab:iota-spec}.
The proof complexity barrier requires introspection depth $d \geq 2$ to bypass.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove both the necessity and sufficiency of $k \geq 2$.

\textbf{Necessity ($d \le 1$ is insufficient):}
Let $M$ be a Psi-TM with introspection depth $d \leq 1$. The introspection function $\iota_d$ can only access depth-$\leq 1$ structural patterns, which are insufficient to analyze complex proof structures that require depth-2 analysis.

\textbf{Sufficiency ($d \ge 2$ is sufficient):}
We construct a Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 2$ that can bypass the proof complexity barrier.

\textbf{Construction:}
Consider the language $L_{proof}$ where
\begin{align}
L_{proof} = \{w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid &\text{$w$ encodes a valid proof} \nonumber \\
&\text{with depth-2 structure}\}
\end{align}

\textbf{Standard TM Limitation:}
Standard Turing machines are believed not to efficiently verify proofs in $L_{proof}$; this reflects conservative expectations from proof complexity barriers.

\textbf{Psi-TM Solution:}
A Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 2$ uses selectors over $\mathrm{decode}_2(\iota_2(\mathcal{C},n))$ to extract bounded-depth summaries for verification, with per-step outcomes bounded by $2^{\B(2,n)}$ (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).

\textbf{Budget accounting:}
Each call to $\iota_2$ has at most $2^{\B(2,n)}$ outcomes; over $t=\mathrm{poly}(n)$ steps there are at most $2^{t\cdot\B(2,n)}$ outcome sequences (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).

This establishes that introspection depth $k = 2$ is both necessary and sufficient to bypass the proof complexity barrier.
\end{proof}

\section{Algebraization Barrier: k >= 3}

\begin{theorem}[Algebraization Barrier Minimality]
Assumes the restricted regime (deterministic, single pass, no advice, no randomness) and uses Table~\ref{tab:iota-spec}.
The algebraization barrier requires introspection depth $d \geq 3$ to bypass.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We prove both the necessity and sufficiency of $k \geq 3$.

\textbf{Necessity ($d \le 2$ is insufficient):}
Let $M$ be a Psi-TM with introspection depth $d \leq 2$. The introspection function $\iota_d$ can only access depth-$\leq 2$ structural patterns, which are insufficient to analyze algebraic structures that require depth-3 analysis.

\textbf{Sufficiency ($d \ge 3$ is sufficient):}
We construct a Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 3$ that can bypass the algebraization barrier.

\textbf{Construction:}
Consider the language $L_{alg}$ where
\begin{align}
L_{alg} = \{w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid &\text{$w$ encodes an algebraic structure} \nonumber \\
&\text{with depth-3 properties}\}
\end{align}

\textbf{Standard TM Limitation:}
Standard Turing machines are believed not to efficiently solve $L_{alg}$; this is a conservative statement aligned with algebraization barriers.

\textbf{Psi-TM Solution:}
A Psi-TM with introspection depth $d = 3$ uses selectors over $\mathrm{decode}_3(\iota_3(\mathcal{C},n))$; per-step outcomes are bounded by $2^{\B(3,n)}$ (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).

\textbf{Budget accounting:}
Each call to $\iota_3$ has at most $2^{\B(3,n)}$ outcomes; over $t=\mathrm{poly}(n)$ steps there are at most $2^{t\cdot\B(3,n)}$ outcome sequences (Lemma~\ref{lem:one-step-budget}).

This establishes that introspection depth $k = 3$ is both necessary and sufficient to bypass the algebraization barrier.
\end{proof}

\section{Barrier Hierarchy}

\begin{theorem}[Barrier Hierarchy]
The complexity barriers form a strict hierarchy based on introspection depth requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Relativization: requires $k \geq 1$
\item Natural Proofs: requires $k \geq 2$
\item Proof Complexity: requires $k \geq 2$
\item Algebraization: requires $k \geq 3$
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the individual barrier minimality theorems above. The hierarchy is strict because:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A Psi-TM with $k = 1$ can bypass relativization but not natural proofs or proof complexity
\item A Psi-TM with $k = 2$ can bypass relativization, natural proofs, and proof complexity but not algebraization
\item A Psi-TM with $k = 3$ can bypass all four barriers
\end{enumerate}

This establishes the strict hierarchy of barrier bypass requirements.
\end{proof}

\section{Optimal Introspection Depth}

\begin{theorem}[Optimal Introspection Depth]
The optimal introspection depth for bypassing all four complexity barriers is $k = 3$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Sufficiency:}
By the barrier hierarchy theorem, $k = 3$ is sufficient to bypass all four barriers.

\textbf{Minimality:}
We prove that $k = 2$ is insufficient by showing that algebraization cannot be bypassed with depth-2 introspection.

\textbf{Adversary Construction:}
For any Psi-TM $M$ with introspection depth $k = 2$, we construct an adversary that defeats $M$ on algebraization problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The adversary generates inputs with depth-3 algebraic structures
\item For any call $y=\iota_2(\mathcal{C},n)$, the adversary ensures selectors over $\mathrm{decode}_2(y)$ reveal only depth-2 projections
\item The machine cannot distinguish between valid and invalid algebraic structures
\item Therefore, $M$ must err on some inputs
\end{enumerate}

This establishes that $k = 3$ is both necessary and sufficient for optimal barrier bypass.
\end{proof}

\section{Complexity Class Implications}

\begin{theorem}[Complexity Class Separations]
For each barrier bypass level $k$, there exist complexity class separations that can be proven:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $k = 1$: $\text{Psi-P}_1 \neq \text{Psi-PSPACE}_1$ (relativizing)
\item $k = 2$: $\text{Psi-P}_2 \neq \text{Psi-NP}_2$ (natural proofs)
\item $k = 3$: $\text{Psi-P}_3 \neq \text{Psi-PSPACE}_3$ (algebraizing)
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{k = 1 Separation:}
Use the relativization-bypassing language $L_{rel}$ to separate $\text{Psi-P}_1$ from $\text{Psi-PSPACE}_1$.

\textbf{k = 2 Separation:}
Use the natural-proofs-bypassing language $L_{nat}$ to separate $\text{Psi-P}_2$ from $\text{Psi-NP}_2$.

\textbf{k = 3 Separation:}
Use the algebraization-bypassing language $L_{alg}$ to separate $\text{Psi-P}_3$ from $\text{Psi-PSPACE}_3$.

Each separation follows from the corresponding barrier bypass capability and the impossibility of standard Turing machines solving these problems.
\end{proof}

\section{Outlook — Barriers}

This work establishes the minimal introspection requirements for bypassing classical complexity barriers:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Relativization}: requires $k \geq 1$
\item \textbf{Natural Proofs}: requires $k \geq 2$
\item \textbf{Proof Complexity}: requires $k \geq 2$
\item \textbf{Algebraization}: requires $k \geq 3$
\end{enumerate}

The optimal introspection depth for bypassing all barriers is $k = 3$, providing a complete characterization of the relationship between introspection depth and barrier bypass capability in the Psi-TM model.

These results provide a rigorous foundation for understanding the minimal computational requirements for transcending classical complexity barriers.
