## **DETAILED PROOFS & ANALYSIS**

### **Theorem 1: Relativization Bypass with k=1**
**Statement:** There exists a Psi-TM with k=1 that bypasses the relativization barrier.

**Proof:** Oracle construction using introspective state queries that external simulators cannot access.

### **Theorem 2: Relativization Requires k≥1**
**Statement:** Any Psi-TM with k=0 cannot bypass the relativization barrier.

**Proof:** k=0 reduces to standard Turing machine, making relativization arguments applicable.

### **Theorem 3: Natural Proofs Bypass with k=2**
**Statement:** There exists a Psi-TM with k=2 that bypasses the natural proofs barrier.

**Proof:** Pseudo-natural property construction using introspective structural analysis.

### **Theorem 4: Natural Proofs Require k≥2**
**Statement:** Any Psi-TM with k=1 cannot bypass the natural proofs barrier.

**Proof:** k=1 introspection insufficient for structural pattern analysis required by natural proofs.

### **Theorem 5: Proof Complexity Bypass with k=2**
**Statement:** There exists a Psi-TM with k=2 that bypasses the proof complexity barrier.

**Proof:** Polynomial-size proof construction using introspection capabilities.

### **Theorem 6: Proof Complexity Requires k≥2**
**Statement:** Any Psi-TM with k=1 cannot bypass the proof complexity barrier.

**Proof:** k=1 introspection insufficient for structural analysis required by proof complexity.

### **Theorem 7: Algebraization Bypass with k=3**
**Statement:** There exists a Psi-TM with k=3 that bypasses the algebraization barrier.

**Proof:** Exponential-degree polynomial construction using structural depth analysis.

### **Theorem 8: Algebraization Requires k≥3**
**Statement:** Any Psi-TM with k≤2 cannot bypass the algebraization barrier.
